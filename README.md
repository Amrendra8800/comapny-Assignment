# Node.js Server, Data Manipulation, and Asynchronous File Handling

This repository contains Node.js scripts to accomplish three tasks: creating a basic Node.js server, performing data manipulation on arrays, and handling asynchronous file operations.

## Task 1: Basic Node.js Server

### How to Run the Server

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the server script.
3. Execute the following command:

4. The server will start and listen on port 3000.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
6. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.


## Task 3: Asynchronous File Handling
A Node.js script that reads a text file named "data.txt" and counts the number of words in it. The script prints the total word count to the console.
Copy code
node Task3.js
The script will read the "data.txt" file and print the total word count to the console.
